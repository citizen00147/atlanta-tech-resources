## A collection of groups, events, and opportunities for developers in the Atlanta, GA area

<br/>

### The Problem

For the past couple of years, I've been looking to join groups and meet other developers, make friends, and connections. I've finally found some but it took a while to sift through dead groups on Meetup and find afforable conventions to network at.

---

<br/>

This list is a collection of active groups and events, all in one place, so you don't have to do the digging!
Please feel free to contribute _(I know there's a lot more out there)_ and open a PR! Just check the [contribution guidelines](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

<br/>

Please reach out with any questions, comments or suggestions. I'd
love to hear how I can keep improving this collection. Shoot me an email at <developer@cmdme.dev>

### <u>Affordable Conventions</u>

- [Atlanta Developer Conference](https://www.atldevcon.com)
  - $10 and lunch is included! A relatively new conference located at Kennesaw State University.
- [Refactr Tech](https://www.refactr.tech)
  - Regular admission goes for $200 and you can add $99 for a workshop. Refactr Tech highlights diversity and inclusion in the tech sphere. A lot of sessions focus on accessibility and marginalized groups of people and give good insight on more than just technical knowledge. It's a small, but great conference that's easy to meet and mingle with others.
